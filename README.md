# vs-studio-workspace
Programming in C#

A collection of C# examples from Intro to C#.

Can be text edited with... https://github.dev/brettjrea/vs-studio-workspace

Was built and tested with [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) on windows.

I opened the whole repo in [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) 

It detected C# and added extensions but I still needed to install.

```sudo apt install mono-complete```

and confirmed that some console examples can be compiled and run in the browser based IDE.


In the terminal. Make sure you are in the correct directory.

Compile with...

```mcs HelloWorld.cs```

Run with...

```mono HelloWorld.exe```
